  <p><pre>The word Shiva is used as an adjective in the Rig Veda (c. 1700–1100 BCE), as an epithet for several Rigvedic deities, including Rudra.[34] The term Shiva also connotes "liberation, final emancipation" and "the auspicious one"; this adjectival usage is addressed to many deities in Vedic literature.[32][35] The term evolved from the Vedic Rudra-Shiva to the noun Shiva in the Epics and the Puranas, as an auspicious deity who is the "creator, reproducer and dissolver".[32][36]
          Sharma presents another etymology with the Sanskrit root śarv-, which means "to injure" or "to kill",[37] interpreting the name to connote "one who can kill the forces of darkness".[38]</pre></p>

<p><pre>Ganpati (Ganesha) is a widely revered Hindu deity known as the elephant-headed remover of obstacles, god of wisdom, intellect, and new beginnings, son of Shiva and Parvati, often depicted with a pot belly and a mouse as his vehicle (vahana), worshipped first in rituals, with his major festival being Ganesh Chaturthi, celebrated with idols and immersion rituals symbolizing his return home.
  <pre>Once upon a time, goddess Parvati made a little boy out of clay while her husband Shiva was away. 
    This boy was Ganesha. Parvati asked him to guard her door. When Shiva returned and tried to enter, 
    Ganesha wouldn’t let him pass. A misunderstanding happened, and Shiva accidentally beheaded Ganesha.
   Parvati was heartbroken. To fix things, Shiva promised to bring the boy back. He asked his helpers 
   to bring the head of the first living creature they found—an elephant! This is how Ganesha got his elephant head and became known as the wise and lovable god.
